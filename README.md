This project is titled "Real-time Food Identification and Calorie Estimation Using MobileNet Architecture." The primary goal is to develop a system that can accurately and efficiently classify various food items in real-time using images, and estimate their calorie content. The system leverages deep learning techniques, specifically the lightweight MobileNet architecture, for feature extraction and classification.

Key components and features of the project include:

Food Image Dataset Collection and Preprocessing: Curated and enhanced datasets with image normalization, augmentation, and labeling to improve model learning.

MobileNet-based Model: Utilized pre-trained MobileNet with custom layers to classify food categories and estimate calories.

Calorie Estimation Module: Integrated a nutritional database to provide calorie values corresponding to identified food items.

Real-time Performance: The system is designed to process images quickly with optimizations suitable for mobile and web applications.

Testing and Validation: Comprehensive testing performed including unit, integration, system, performance, and edge cases such as mixed dishes or poor-quality images.

Challenges: Overcame obstacles like computational power demands and dataset limitations by using transfer learning and data augmentation.

Future Enhancements: Plans include expanding the food database to cover international cuisines, improving portion size estimation with 3D techniques, and applying mathematical health impact assessments.

This project demonstrates practical application of deep learning for personalized dietary monitoring, enabling users to make informed nutritional decisions without manual logging.
